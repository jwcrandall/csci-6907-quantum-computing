\item[1.] \textbf{Decision Trees (10pt):} In class we discussed the example of buying a car and the bank using a Decision Tree to decide whether a client is in the high or low risk category for the loan. Our tree had 2 decision steps. \textbf{Q:} Redo the tree, but design it with a only a single decision step. Show that tree. 

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{A singe step decision tree}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\If{$income > x$}
    \State approve loan
\Else
    \State reject loan
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\textbf{Q:} What role has the no in this case? \textbf{A:} Low savings low income, and high savings low income.
